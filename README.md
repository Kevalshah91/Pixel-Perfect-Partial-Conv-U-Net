## Understanding the Architecture ðŸŽ¨
The **Partial Convolution U-Net** is an evolved version of the classic U-Net architecture. Here's how it works:

- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: 
  - The encoder compresses the input image into a compact feature representation by progressively reducing spatial dimensions. 
  - The decoder reconstructs the image by upsampling and refining these features, aiming to restore missing or corrupted regions.

- **Partial Convolutions**: 
  - Unlike standard convolutions, partial convolutions use a mask to ensure only valid (non-missing) pixels contribute to the computation. This makes it ideal for handling irregularly missing data.
  - The mask updates dynamically during training, learning to "fill in the blanks" intelligently.

- **Skip Connections**: 
  - Bridges between encoder and decoder layers preserve spatial details lost during downsampling, enhancing the reconstruction quality.

This combination creates a model that's both robust and highly adaptable to various tasks, such as inpainting, segmentation, and restoration.
